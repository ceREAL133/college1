        <b>In <sub>Apex</sub></b> <sup>Legends</sup>   , players in squads of two or three select a character with pre-set abilities, referred to as a Legend, and battle against other players to be the last squad standing. Players earn experience based on their performance in matches, through which they can earn Apex Packs that contain cosmetic items. Cosmetics can also be purchased from the in-game store, earned through seasonal Battle Passes, or awarded through limited-time events.

        In <i>a standart</i> Battle Royale match, all 60 players start in the same dropship flying over the map, and each squad can decide when and where they want to skydive onto the island below. Squads will then scavenge for weapons, materials, and loot, and work with their squadmates to combat other players. When an enemy dies, they drop a deathbox containing all of their loot, which can then be accessed by everybody. Though Apex Legends has both voice and text team chat like most multiplayer first-person shooters, it also includes a ping system so that players can communicate simple concepts without external inp
        uts.

        <u>Players</u> can also revive any squadmate downed by enemies and respawn squadmates who die by reliieving their Banner from their deathbox. The match is divided into rounds, marked by the shrinking stages of the Ring, which makes the playable area narrower and narrower until eventually enveloping the entire map. In addition, Care Packages and Replicators are periodically dropped into the playable area to provide exlia loot.
